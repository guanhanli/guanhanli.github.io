    <h1>10 Interesting Facts About Japan</h1>
    <p>Japan is a very beautiful and fascinating country, but it seems a lot of people only know the barest<br /> minimum of facts related to this ancient culture. It’s time to remedy that, and teach you that …</p>

        <h2>Eating Raw Horse Meat Is Very Common in Japan</h2><br />

        <p>
          Many people would cringe at the thought of eating horse meat, especially if it’s raw and cold. But in<br />
          Japan, raw horse meat, also called basashi, is considered a delicacy and is served in many<br />
          restaurants. Eating raw horse meat is not a recent fad popularized by a celebrity or an innovative<br />
          chef, though — it’s been practiced by the Japanese for many decades now.
        </p>
        <p>Before you dismiss the idea of trying basashi, know that it’s much healthier than pork and beef, and<br />
          is less prone to E. coli contamination. It is very high in protein yet low in calories, and is rich in<br />
          Linoleic Acid. Aside from that, eating horse meat may possibly prolong your life. A demographic<br />
          statistics published in 2013 showed that the residents of the Nagano prefecture had the highest<br />
          life expectancy in Japan: 80.88 years for men and 87.18 for women. Their secret: eating horse<br />
          meat.</p>

        <h2>1,500 Earthquakes Hit Japan Every Year</h2>
        <img src='https://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Tohoku-Earthquake-640x426.jpg' />
        <p>Though Japan is a very beautiful country, it is also quite deadly, not because of its thiefs and traitors (it’s<br/>
          safety has one of the hightest ratings in the world), but primarily because it’s one of the places in the world<br/>
          where earth-quakes happen the most. It experiences 1,500 earthquakes every year. Thankfully, most of these<br/>
          quakes are just tremors. Japan is no stranger to devastating earthquakes. It has experienced<br/>
          several catastrophic quakes in the past that has led to the destruction of billions of<br/>
          dollars worth of properties and the death of thousands of people.</p>
        <p>Japan’s geographical location is the primary factor as to why it’s prone to earthquakes. It is situated<br/>
          on top of four massive tectonic plates. When these plates move, earthquakes are produced. In<br />
          2011, these tectonic plates had a massive movement that resulted into a catastrophic event.<br />
          Considered as the strongest and biggest earthquake in Japan, the Tohoku Earthquake of 2011 had<br />
          a magnitude of 9.0. Though it was the strongest and the biggest, the Tohoku Earthquake was not<br />
          the deadliest in Japan’s history. It only killed around 29,000 people. In fact, Japan’s deadliest<br />
          earthquake, the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, only had a magnitude of 7.9, and yet it killed<br />
          about 142,800 Japanese residents.</p>

        <h2>Japan Is Home to the World’s Craziest Vending Machines</h2>
        <img src='https://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/japanese-vending-machines.jpg' />
        <p>
          People in Japan love <a href='https://www.insidejapantours.com/blog/2018/05/11/guide-to-japanese-vending-machines/'>vending machines</a>. In fact, there are around 5.52 million of them<br />
          scattered throughout the country. Over the years, these machines have greatly evolved from being<br />
          practically convenient to extremely bizarre. In most countries, vending machines typically sell <br />
          snacks like chips, gums, candies, sodas, and chocolates. However, the Japanese seemed to have<br />
          combined the practicality of vending machines with their love for innovation and bizarre everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Japan, it’s perfectly normal for vending machines to sell fresh eggs, bags of rice, and even fresh<br/>
          bouquets of flowers. If these aren’t enough to amuse you, they also sell toilet paper, condoms,<br/>
          umbrellas, fish baits, and even porn magazines. Crazy, yet oddly convenient.
